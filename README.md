# OrgBoard

## Project Description
**OrgBoard** is a financial dashboard designed specifically for campus organizations and student leaders to streamline collaboration, budgeting, and communication for campus events. The name “OrgBoard” reflects its role as an organizational hub — a digital board where all essential financial data, reports, and updates are transparently managed and shared. The system OrgBoard helps them submit budget requests, track spending, and keep clear records so nothing is lost or forgotten. Addresses the common problem of miscommunication, lack of financial transparency, and scattered reporting among student organizations during event planning and fund management.

## Features Implemented
- **Automated Budget Logs**

- **Real-Time Progress Tracking**
